# Uber-Fares-Dataset-Analysis
As Uber expands its urban mobility services, understanding the dynamics of fare pricing, trip duration, and temporal patterns is crucial to ensure both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze Uber ride data to identify patterns in fare pricing, ride frequency, and time-based trends. The dataset contains raw and sometimes inconsistent records, making it essential to clean and transform the data before drawing insights. By exploring relationships between fare amounts, trip times, and distances, the goal is to create a clear and interactive Power BI dashboard that helps reveal peak periods, potential pricing inefficiencies, and ride behavior to support data-driven decision-making.
